# Image classification of cats:

This project was made as a modified version of the final project in my Coursera NN Certification.  

- This is a Neural Network written in python from scratch. It classifies cat and non-cat pictures.
- The code is present in the [NN_Python_cats.ipynb](https://github.com/abhi094/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20in%20Python/NN_Python_cats.ipynb) notebook.

### To Do :
1. code restructuring
2. make a web app with Flask api and 
3. make a Dash front end
4. Containerize with Docker and deploy in AWS.
