# Classification of cat vs. non-cat images 

- This is a Neural Network written in python from scratch. It classifies cat and non-cat pictures.
- The code is present in the [NN_Python_cats.ipynb](https://github.com/abhi094/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20in%20Python/NN_Python_cats.ipynb) notebook.
- Plan to deploy this in AWS in the near future .
